# Payload Website Template

This is the official [Payload Website Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/templates/website). Use it to power websites, blogs, or portfolios from small to enterprise. This repo includes a fully-working backend, enterprise-grade admin panel, and a beautifully designed, production-ready website.

This template is right for you if you are working on:

- A personal or enterprise-grade website, blog, or portfolio
- A content publishing platform with a fully featured publication workflow
- Exploring the capabilities of Payload

Core features:

- [Redirects](#redirects)
- [Jobs and Scheduled Publishing](#jobs-and-scheduled-publish)
- [Website](#website)

## Quick Start

To spin up this example locally, follow these steps:

### Clone

If you have not done so already, you need to have standalone copy of this repo on your machine. If you've already cloned this repo, skip to [Development](#development).

Use the `create-payload-app` CLI to clone this template directly to your machine:

```bash
pnpx create-payload-app my-project -t website
```

### Development

1. First [clone the repo](#clone) if you have not done so already
1. `cd my-project && cp .env.example .env` to copy the example environment variables
1. `pnpm install && pnpm dev` to install dependencies and start the dev server
1. open `http://localhost:3000` to open the app in your browser

That's it! Changes made in `./src` will be reflected in your app. Follow the on-screen instructions to login and create your first admin user. Then check out [Production](#production) once you're ready to build and serve your app, and [Deployment](#deployment) when you're ready to go live.

## How it works

The Payload config is tailored specifically to the needs of most websites. It is pre-configured in the following ways:

### Collections

See the [Collections](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections) docs for details on how to extend this functionality.

- #### Users (Authentication)

  Users are auth-enabled collections that have access to the admin panel and unpublished content. See [Access Control](#access-control) for more details.

  For additional help, see the official [Auth Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/auth) or the [Authentication](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/overview#authentication-overview) docs.

- #### Posts

  Posts are used to generate blog posts, news articles, or any other type of content that is published over time. All posts are layout builder enabled so you can generate unique layouts for each post using layout-building blocks, see [Layout Builder](#layout-builder) for more details. Posts are also draft-enabled so you can preview them before publishing them to your website, see [Draft Preview](#draft-preview) for more details.

- #### Pages

  All pages are layout builder enabled so you can generate unique layouts for each page using layout-building blocks, see [Layout Builder](#layout-builder) for more details. Pages are also draft-enabled so you can preview them before publishing them to your website, see [Draft Preview](#draft-preview) for more details.

- #### Media

  This is the uploads enabled collection used by pages, posts, and projects to contain media like images, videos, downloads, and other assets. It features pre-configured sizes, focal point and manual resizing to help you manage your pictures.

- #### Categories

  A taxonomy used to group posts together. Categories can be nested inside of one another, for example "News > Technology". See the official [Payload Nested Docs Plugin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/nested-docs) for more details.

### Globals

See the [Globals](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/globals) docs for details on how to extend this functionality.

- `Header`

  The data required by the header on your front-end like nav links.

- `Footer`

  Same as above but for the footer of your site.

## Access control

Basic access control is setup to limit access to various content based based on publishing status.

- `users`: Users can access the admin panel and create or edit content.
- `posts`: Everyone can access published posts, but only users can create, update, or delete them.
- `pages`: Everyone can access published pages, but only users can create, update, or delete them.

For more details on how to extend this functionality, see the [Payload Access Control](https://payloadcms.com/docs/access-control/overview#access-control) docs.

## Layout Builder

Create unique page layouts for any type of content using a powerful layout builder. This template comes pre-configured with the following layout building blocks:

- Hero
- Content
- Media
- Call To Action
- Archive

Each block is fully designed and built into the front-end website that comes with this template. See [Website](#website) for more details.

## Lexical editor

A deep editorial experience that allows complete freedom to focus just on writing content without breaking out of the flow with support for Payload blocks, media, links and other features provided out of the box. See [Lexical](https://payloadcms.com/docs/rich-text/overview) docs.

## Draft Preview

All posts and pages are draft-enabled so you can preview them before publishing them to your website. To do this, these collections use [Versions](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections#versions) with `drafts` set to `true`. This means that when you create a new post, project, or page, it will be saved as a draft and will not be visible on your website until you publish it. This also means that you can preview your draft before publishing it to your website. To do this, we automatically format a custom URL which redirects to your front-end to securely fetch the draft version of your content.

Since the front-end of this template is statically generated, this also means that pages, posts, and projects will need to be regenerated as changes are made to published documents. To do this, we use an `afterChange` hook to regenerate the front-end when a document has changed and its `_status` is `published`.

For more details on how to extend this functionality, see the official [Draft Preview Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/examples/draft-preview).

## Live preview

In addition to draft previews you can also enable live preview to view your end resulting page as you're editing content with full support for SSR rendering. See [Live preview docs](https://payloadcms.com/docs/live-preview/overview) for more details.

## On-demand Revalidation

We've added hooks to collections and globals so that all of your pages, posts, footer, or header changes will automatically be updated in the frontend via on-demand revalidation supported by Nextjs.

> Note: if an image has been changed, for example it's been cropped, you will need to republish the page it's used on in order to be able to revalidate the Nextjs image cache.

## SEO

This template comes pre-configured with the official [Payload SEO Plugin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/seo) for complete SEO control from the admin panel. All SEO data is fully integrated into the front-end website that comes with this template. See [Website](#website) for more details.

## Search

This template also pre-configured with the official [Payload Search Plugin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/search) to showcase how SSR search features can easily be implemented into Next.js with Payload. See [Website](#website) for more details.

## Redirects

If you are migrating an existing site or moving content to a new URL, you can use the `redirects` collection to create a proper redirect from old URLs to new ones. This will ensure that proper request status codes are returned to search engines and that your users are not left with a broken link. This template comes pre-configured with the official [Payload Redirects Plugin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/redirects) for complete redirect control from the admin panel. All redirects are fully integrated into the front-end website that comes with this template. See [Website](#website) for more details.

## Jobs and Scheduled Publish

We have configured [Scheduled Publish](https://payloadcms.com/docs/versions/drafts#scheduled-publish) which uses the [jobs queue](https://payloadcms.com/docs/jobs-queue/jobs) in order to publish or unpublish your content on a scheduled time. The tasks are run on a cron schedule and can also be run as a separate instance if needed.

> Note: When deployed on Vercel, depending on the plan tier, you may be limited to daily cron only.

## Website

This template includes a beautifully designed, production-ready front-end built with the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org), served right alongside your Payload app in a instance. This makes it so that you can deploy both your backend and website where you need it.

Core features:

- [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com)
- [Payload Admin Bar](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/admin-bar)
- [TailwindCSS styling](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [shadcn/ui components](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- User Accounts and Authentication
- Fully featured blog
- Publication workflow
- Dark mode
- Pre-made layout building blocks
- SEO
- Search
- Redirects
- Live preview

### Cache

Although Next.js includes a robust set of caching strategies out of the box, Payload Cloud proxies and caches all files through Cloudflare using the [Official Cloud Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@payloadcms/payload-cloud). This means that Next.js caching is not needed and is disabled by default. If you are hosting your app outside of Payload Cloud, you can easily reenable the Next.js caching mechanisms by removing the `no-store` directive from all fetch requests in `./src/app/_api` and then removing all instances of `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` from pages files, such as `./src/app/(pages)/[slug]/page.tsx`. For more details, see the official [Next.js Caching Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching).

## Development

To spin up this example locally, follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start). Then [Seed](#seed) the database with a few pages, posts, and projects.

### Working with Postgres

Postgres and other SQL-based databases follow a strict schema for managing your data. In comparison to our MongoDB adapter, this means that there's a few extra steps to working with Postgres.

Note that often times when making big schema changes you can run the risk of losing data if you're not manually migrating it.

#### Local development

Ideally we recommend running a local copy of your database so that schema updates are as fast as possible. By default the Postgres adapter has `push: true` for development environments. This will let you add, modify and remove fields and collections without needing to run any data migrations.

If your database is pointed to production you will want to set `push: false` otherwise you will risk losing data or having your migrations out of sync.

#### Migrations

[Migrations](https://payloadcms.com/docs/database/migrations) are essentially SQL code versions that keeps track of your schema. When deploy with Postgres you will need to make sure you create and then run your migrations.

Locally create a migration

```bash
pnpm payload migrate:create
```

This creates the migration files you will need to push alongside with your new configuration.

On the server after building and before running `pnpm start` you will want to run your migrations

```bash
pnpm payload migrate
```

This command will check for any migrations that have not yet been run and try to run them and it will keep a record of migrations that have been run in the database.

### Docker

Alternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to spin up this template locally. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Follow [steps 1 and 2 from above](#development), the docker-compose file will automatically use the `.env` file in your project root
1. Next run `docker-compose up`
1. Follow [steps 4 and 5 from above](#development) to login and create your first admin user

That's it! The Docker instance will help you get up and running quickly while also standardizing the development environment across your teams.

### Seed

To seed the database with a few pages, posts, and projects you can click the 'seed database' link from the admin panel.

The seed script will also create a demo user for demonstration purposes only:

- Demo Author
  - Email: `demo-author@payloadcms.com`
  - Password: `password`

> NOTICE: seeding the database is destructive because it drops your current database to populate a fresh one from the seed template. Only run this command if you are starting a new project or can afford to lose your current data.

## Production

To run Payload in production, you need to build and start the Admin panel. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Invoke the `next build` script by running `pnpm build` or `npm run build` in your project root. This creates a `.next` directory with a production-ready admin bundle.
1. Finally run `pnpm start` or `npm run start` to run Node in production and serve Payload from the `.build` directory.
1. When you're ready to go live, see Deployment below for more details.

### Deploying to Vercel

This template can also be deployed to Vercel for free. You can get started by choosing the Vercel DB adapter during the setup of the template or by manually installing and configuring it:

```bash
pnpm add @payloadcms/db-vercel-postgres
```

```ts
// payload.config.ts
import { vercelPostgresAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-vercel-postgres'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  db: vercelPostgresAdapter({
    pool: {
      connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_URL || '',
    },
  }),
  // ...
```

We also support Vercel's blob storage:

```bash
pnpm add @payloadcms/storage-vercel-blob
```

```ts
// payload.config.ts
import { vercelBlobStorage } from '@payloadcms/storage-vercel-blob'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    vercelBlobStorage({
      collections: {
        [Media.slug]: true,
      },
      token: process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN || '',
    }),
  ],
  // ...
```

There is also a simplified [one click deploy](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/templates/with-vercel-postgres) to Vercel should you need it.

### Self-hosting

Before deploying your app, you need to:

1. Ensure your app builds and serves in production. See [Production](#production) for more details.
2. You can then deploy Payload as you would any other Node.js or Next.js application either directly on a VPS, DigitalOcean's Apps Platform, via Coolify or more. More guides coming soon.

You can also deploy your app manually, check out the [deployment documentation](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/deployment) for full details.

# Advanced Access Control Patterns

Advanced access control patterns including context-aware access, time-based restrictions, factory functions, and production templates.

## Context-Aware Access Patterns

### Locale-Specific Access

```typescript
import type { Access } from 'payload'

export const localeSpecificAccess: Access = ({ req: { user, locale } }) => {
  // Authenticated users can access all locales
  if (user) return true

  // Public users can only access English content
  if (locale === 'en') return true

  return false
}
```

### Device-Specific Access

```typescript
export const mobileOnlyAccess: Access = ({ req: { headers } }) => {
  const userAgent = headers?.get('user-agent') || ''
  return /mobile|android|iphone/i.test(userAgent)
}

export const desktopOnlyAccess: Access = ({ req: { headers } }) => {
  const userAgent = headers?.get('user-agent') || ''
  return !/mobile|android|iphone/i.test(userAgent)
}
```

### IP-Based Access

```typescript
export const restrictedIpAccess = (allowedIps: string[]): Access => {
  return ({ req: { headers } }) => {
    const ip = headers?.get('x-forwarded-for') || headers?.get('x-real-ip')
    return allowedIps.includes(ip || '')
  }
}

// Usage
const internalIps = ['192.168.1.0/24', '10.0.0.5']

export const InternalDocs: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'internal-docs',
  access: {
    read: restrictedIpAccess(internalIps),
  },
}
```

## Time-Based Access Patterns

### Today's Records Only

```typescript
export const todayOnlyAccess: Access = ({ req: { user } }) => {
  if (!user) return false

  const now = new Date()
  const startOfDay = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate())
  const endOfDay = new Date(startOfDay.getTime() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)

  return {
    createdAt: {
      greater_than_equal: startOfDay.toISOString(),
      less_than: endOfDay.toISOString(),
    },
  }
}
```

### Recent Records (Last N Days)

```typescript
export const recentRecordsAccess = (days: number): Access => {
  return ({ req: { user } }) => {
    if (!user) return false
    if (user.roles?.includes('admin')) return true

    const cutoff = new Date()
    cutoff.setDate(cutoff.getDate() - days)

    return {
      createdAt: {
        greater_than_equal: cutoff.toISOString(),
      },
    }
  }
}

// Usage: Users see only last 30 days, admins see all
export const Logs: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'logs',
  access: {
    read: recentRecordsAccess(30),
  },
}
```

### Scheduled Content (Publish Date Range)

```typescript
export const scheduledContentAccess: Access = ({ req: { user } }) => {
  // Editors see all content
  if (user?.roles?.includes('admin') || user?.roles?.includes('editor')) {
    return true
  }

  const now = new Date().toISOString()

  // Public sees only content within publish window
  return {
    and: [
      { publishDate: { less_than_equal: now } },
      {
        or: [{ unpublishDate: { exists: false } }, { unpublishDate: { greater_than: now } }],
      },
    ],
  }
}
```

## Subscription-Based Access

### Active Subscription Required

```typescript
export const activeSubscriptionAccess: Access = async ({ req: { user } }) => {
  if (!user) return false
  if (user.roles?.includes('admin')) return true

  try {
    const subscription = await req.payload.findByID({
      collection: 'subscriptions',
      id: user.subscriptionId,
    })

    return subscription?.status === 'active'
  } catch {
    return false
  }
}
```

### Subscription Tier-Based Access

```typescript
export const tierBasedAccess = (requiredTier: string): Access => {
  const tierHierarchy = ['free', 'basic', 'pro', 'enterprise']

  return async ({ req: { user } }) => {
    if (!user) return false
    if (user.roles?.includes('admin')) return true

    try {
      const subscription = await req.payload.findByID({
        collection: 'subscriptions',
        id: user.subscriptionId,
      })

      if (subscription?.status !== 'active') return false

      const userTierIndex = tierHierarchy.indexOf(subscription.tier)
      const requiredTierIndex = tierHierarchy.indexOf(requiredTier)

      return userTierIndex >= requiredTierIndex
    } catch {
      return false
    }
  }
}

// Usage
export const EnterpriseFeatures: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'enterprise-features',
  access: {
    read: tierBasedAccess('enterprise'),
  },
}
```

## Factory Functions

### createRoleBasedAccess

```typescript
export function createRoleBasedAccess(roles: string[]): Access {
  return ({ req: { user } }) => {

```

## Configuration Templates

### Public + Authenticated Collection

```typescript
export const PublicAuthCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'posts',
  access: {
    // Only admins/editors can create
    create: ({ req: { user } }) => {
      return user?.roles?.some((role) => ['admin', 'editor'].includes(role)) || false
    },

    // Authenticated users see all, public sees only published
    read: ({ req: { user } }) => {
      if (user) return true
      return { _status: { equals: 'published' } }
    },

    // Only admins/editors can update
    update: ({ req: { user } }) => {
      return user?.roles?.some((role) => ['admin', 'editor'].includes(role)) || false
    },

    // Only admins can delete
    delete: ({ req: { user } }) => {
      return user?.roles?.includes('admin') || false
    },
  },
  versions: {
    drafts: true,
  },
  fields: [
    { name: 'title', type: 'text', required: true },
    { name: 'content', type: 'richText', required: true },
    { name: 'author', type: 'relationship', relationTo: 'users' },
  ],
}
```

### Self-Service Collection

```typescript
export const SelfServiceCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'users',
  auth: true,
  access: {
    // Admins can create users
    create: ({ req: { user } }) => user?.roles?.includes('admin') || false,

    // Anyone can read user profiles
    read: () => true,

    // Users can update self, admins can update anyone
    update: ({ req: { user }, id }) => {
      if (!user) return false
      if (user.roles?.includes('admin')) return true
      return user.id === id
    },

    // Only admins can delete
    delete: ({ req: { user } }) => user?.roles?.includes('admin') || false,
  },
  fields: [
    { name: 'name', type: 'text', required: true },
    { name: 'email', type: 'email', required: true },
    {
      name: 'roles',
      type: 'select',
      hasMany: true,
      options: ['admin', 'editor', 'user'],
      access: {
        // Only admins can read/update roles
        read: ({ req: { user } }) => user?.roles?.includes('admin') || false,
        update: ({ req: { user } }) => user?.roles?.includes('admin') || false,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Avoid Async Operations in Hot Paths

```typescript
// ❌ Slow: Multiple sequential async calls
export const slowAccess: Access = async ({ req: { user } }) => {
  const org = await req.payload.findByID({ collection: 'orgs', id: user.orgId })
  const team = await req.payload.findByID({ collection: 'teams', id: user.teamId })
  const subscription = await req.payload.findByID({ collection: 'subs', id: user.subId })

  return org.active && team.active && subscription.active
}

// ✅ Fast: Use query constraints or cache in context
export const fastAccess: Access = ({ req: { user, context } }) => {
  // Cache expensive lookups
  if (!context.orgStatus) {
    context.orgStatus = checkOrgStatus(user.orgId)
  }

  return context.orgStatus
}
```

### Query Constraint Optimization

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid: Non-indexed fields in constraints
export const slowQuery: Access = () => ({
  'metadata.internalCode': { equals: 'ABC123' }, // Slow if not indexed
})

// ✅ Better: Use indexed fields
export const fastQuery: Access = () => ({
  status: { equals: 'active' }, // Indexed field
  organizationId: { in: ['org1', 'org2'] }, // Indexed field
})
```

### Field Access on Large Arrays

```typescript
// ❌ Slow: Complex access on array fields
{
  name: 'items',
  type: 'array',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'secretData',
      type: 'text',
      access: {
        read: async ({ req }) => {
          // Async call runs for EVERY array item
          const result = await expensiveCheck()
          return result
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}

// ✅ Fast: Simple checks or cache result
{
  name: 'items',
  type: 'array',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'secretData',
      type: 'text',
      access: {
        read: ({ req: { user }, context }) => {
          // Cache once, reuse for all items
          if (context.canReadSecret === undefined) {
            context.canReadSecret = user?.roles?.includes('admin')
          }
          return context.canReadSecret
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

### Avoid N+1 Queries

```typescript
// ❌ N+1 Problem: Query per access check
export const n1Access: Access = async ({ req, id }) => {
  // Runs for EACH document in list
  const doc = await req.payload.findByID({ collection: 'docs', id })
  return doc.isPublic
}

// ✅ Better: Use query constraint to filter at DB level
export const efficientAccess: Access = () => {
  return { isPublic: { equals: true } }
}
```

## Debugging Tips

### Log Access Check Execution

```typescript
export const debugAccess: Access = ({ req: { user }, id }) => {
  console.log('Access check:', {
    userId: user?.id,
    userRoles: user?.roles,
    docId: id,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  })
  return true
}
```

### Verify Arguments Availability

```typescript
export const checkArgsAccess: Access = (args) => {
  console.log('Available arguments:', {
    hasReq: 'req' in args,
    hasUser: args.req?.user ? 'yes' : 'no',
    hasId: args.id ? 'provided' : 'undefined',
    hasData: args.data ? 'provided' : 'undefined',
  })
  return true
}
```

### Test Access Without User

```typescript
// In test/development
const testAccess = await payload.find({
  collection: 'posts',
  overrideAccess: false, // Enforce access control
  user: undefined, // Simulate no user
})

console.log('Public access result:', testAccess.docs.length)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Default Deny**: Start with restrictive access, gradually add permissions
2. **Type Guards**: Use TypeScript for user type safety
3. **Validate Data**: Never trust frontend-provided IDs or data
4. **Async for Critical Checks**: Use async operations for important security decisions
5. **Consistent Logic**: Apply same rules at field and collection levels
6. **Test Edge Cases**: Test with no user, wrong user, admin user scenarios
7. **Monitor Access**: Log failed access attempts for security review
8. **Regular Audit**: Review access rules quarterly or after major changes
9. **Cache Wisely**: Use `req.context` for expensive operations
10. **Document Intent**: Add comments explaining complex access rules
11. **Avoid Secrets in Client**: Never expose sensitive logic to client-side
12. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Access functions should return `false` on error, not throw
13. **Test Local API**: Remember to set `overrideAccess: false` when testing
14. **Consider Performance**: Measure impact of async operations
15. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum access required

## Performance Summary

**Minimize Async Operations**: Use query constraints over async lookups when possible

**Cache Expensive Checks**: Store results in `req.context` for reuse

**Index Query Fields**: Ensure fields in query constraints are indexed

**Avoid Complex Logic in Array Fields**: Simple boolean checks preferred

**Use Query Constraints**: Let database filter rather than loading all records
