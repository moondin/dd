title: Adding Images, Fonts, and Files
---

With webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.

You can **`import` a file right in a JavaScript module**. This tells webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path you can reference in your code, e.g. as the `src` attribute of an image or the `href` of a link to a PDF.

To reduce the number of requests to the server, importing images that are less than 10,000 bytes returns a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) instead of a path. This applies to the following file extensions: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, and png. SVG files are excluded due to [#1153](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1153). You can control the 10,000 byte threshold by setting the `IMAGE_INLINE_SIZE_LIMIT` environment variable as documented in our [advanced configuration](advanced-configuration.md).

Here is an example:

```js
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.png'; // Tell webpack this JS file uses this image

console.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png

function Header() {
  // Import result is the URL of your image
  return <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />;
}

export default Header;
```

This ensures that when the project is built, webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.

This works in CSS too:

```css
.Logo {
  background-image: url(./logo.png);
}
```

webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.

Please be advised that this is also a custom feature of webpack.

**It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).

An alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.

## Adding SVGs

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher, and `react@16.3.0` and higher.

One way to add SVG files was described in the section above. You can also import SVGs directly as React components. You can use either of the two approaches. In your code it would look like this:

```js
import { ReactComponent as Logo } from './logo.svg';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Logo is an actual React component */}
      <Logo />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This is handy if you don't want to load SVG as a separate file. Don't forget the curly braces in the import! The `ReactComponent` import name is significant and tells Create React App that you want a React component that renders an SVG, rather than its filename.

> **Tip:** The imported SVG React Component accepts a `title` prop along with other props that a `svg` element accepts. Use this prop to add an accessible title to your svg component.
```

Relay is a framework for building data-driven React applications powered by GraphQL. The current release of Relay works with Create React App projects out of the box using Babel Macros. Set up your project as shown in the [Relay documentation](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), then make sure you have a version of the babel plugin providing the macro.

To add it, run:

```sh
npm install --save babel-plugin-relay
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add babel-plugin-relay
```

Then, wherever you use the `graphql` template tag, import the macro:

```js
import graphql from 'babel-plugin-relay/macro';
// instead of:
//   import { graphql } from "babel-plugin-relay"

graphql`
  query UserQuery {
    viewer {
      id
    }
  }
`;
```

To learn more about Relay, check out [its documentation](https://facebook.github.io/relay/).

title: Adding TypeScript
---

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@2.1.0` and higher.

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## Installation

To start a new Create React App project with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), you can run:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

or

```sh
yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
```

> If you've previously installed `create-react-app` globally via `npm install -g create-react-app`, we recommend you uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` or `yarn global remove create-react-app` to ensure that `npx` always uses the latest version.
>
> Global installs of `create-react-app` are no longer supported.

To add [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to an existing Create React App project, first install it:

```sh
npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
```

or

```sh
yarn add typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
```

Next, rename any file to be a TypeScript file (e.g. `src/index.js` to `src/index.tsx`) and create tsconfig.json if it's not in the root of your project [`tsconfig.json` file](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html).

Finally **restart your development server**!

Type errors will show up in the same console as the build one. You'll have to fix these type errors before you continue development or build your project. For advanced configuration, [see here](advanced-configuration.md).

## Getting Started with TypeScript and React

You are not required to make a [`tsconfig.json` file](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html), one will be made for you. You are allowed to edit the generated TypeScript configuration.

- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TypeScript Example on React](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html?jsx=2&esModuleInterop=true&e=196#example/typescript-with-react)
- [React + TypeScript Cheatsheets](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet#reacttypescript-cheatsheets) has a good overview on how to use React with TypeScript

## Troubleshooting

If your project is not created with TypeScript enabled, npx may be using a cached version of `create-react-app`. Remove previously installed versions with `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` or `yarn global remove create-react-app` (see [#6119](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6119#issuecomment-451614035)).

If you are currently using [create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript/), see [this blog post](https://vincenttunru.com/migrate-create-react-app-typescript-to-create-react-app/) for instructions on how to migrate to Create React App.

Constant enums and namespaces are not supported, you can learn about the constraints of [using Babel with TypeScript here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-typescript#caveats).

| BROWSER                   |   ✅ Used   | 🚫 Ignored | By default, Create React App will open the default system browser, favoring Chrome on macOS. Specify a [browser](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open#app) to override this behavior, or set it to `none` to disable it completely. If you need to customize the way the browser is launched, you can specify a node script instead. Any arguments passed to `npm start` will also be passed to this script, and the url where your app is served will be the last argument. Your script's file name must have the `.js` extension.                                                                                                                                      |

[Ejecting](available-scripts.md#npm-run-eject) lets you customize anything, but from that point on you have to maintain the configuration and scripts yourself. This can be daunting if you have many similar projects. In such cases instead of ejecting we recommend to _fork_ `react-scripts` and any other packages you need. [This article](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-configure-create-react-app/) covers how to do it in depth. You can find more discussion in [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/682).

[Source map explorer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-explorer) analyzes
JavaScript bundles using the source maps. This helps you understand where code
bloat is coming from.

To add Source map explorer to a Create React App project, follow these steps:

```sh
npm install --save source-map-explorer
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add source-map-explorer
```

Then in `package.json`, add the following line to `scripts`:

```diff
   "scripts": {
+    "analyze": "source-map-explorer 'build/static/js/*.js'",
     "start": "react-scripts start",
     "build": "react-scripts build",
     "test": "react-scripts test",
```

Then to analyze the bundle run the production build then run the analyze
script.

```sh
npm run build
npm run analyze
```
```

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](running-tests.md) for more information.

## `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. If necessary, classnames and function names can be enabled for profiling purposes. See the [production build](production-build.md) section for more information.

Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](deployment.md) for more information about deploying your application to popular hosting providers.

## `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project as dependencies in `package.json`. Technically, the distinction between dependencies and development dependencies is pretty arbitrary for front-end apps that produce static bundles.

In addition, it used to cause problems with some hosting platforms that didn't install development dependencies (and thus weren't able to build the project on the server or test it right before deployment). You are free to rearrange your dependencies in `package.json` as you see fit.

All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

title: Can I Use Decorators?
---

Some popular libraries use [decorators](https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841) in their documentation.

Create React App intentionally doesn’t support decorator syntax at the moment because:

- It is an experimental proposal and is subject to change (in fact, it has already changed once, and will change again).
- Most libraries currently support only the old version of the proposal — which will never be a standard.

However in many cases you can rewrite decorator-based code without decorators and achieve the same result.

Please refer to these two threads for reference:

- [#214](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/214)
- [#411](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/411)

Create React App will add decorator support when the specification advances to a stable stage.

title: Code Splitting
---

Instead of downloading the entire app before users can use it, code splitting allows you to split your code into small chunks which you can then load on demand.

This project setup supports code splitting via [dynamic `import()`](https://2ality.com/2017/01/import-operator.html#loading-code-on-demand). Its [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) is in stage 4. The `import()` function-like form takes the module name as an argument and returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which always resolves to the namespace object of the module.

Here is an example:

## `moduleA.js`

```js
const moduleA = 'Hello';

export { moduleA };
```

## `App.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  handleClick = () => {
    import('./moduleA')
      .then(({ moduleA }) => {
        // Use moduleA
      })
      .catch(err => {
        // Handle failure
      });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Load</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

This will make `moduleA.js` and all its unique dependencies as a separate chunk that only loads after the user clicks the 'Load' button. For more information on the chunks that are created, see the [production build](production-build.md) section.

You can also use it with `async` / `await` syntax if you prefer it.

## With React Router

If you are using React Router check out [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#route-based-code-splitting)

Custom Templates enable you to select a template to create your project from, while still retaining all of the features of Create React App.

You'll notice that Custom Templates are always named in the format `cra-template-[template-name]`, however you only need to provide the `[template-name]` to the creation command.

Scoped templates are also supported, under the name `@[scope-name]/cra-template` or `@[scope-name]/cra-template-[template-name]`, which can be installed via `@[scope]` and `@[scope]/[template-name]` respectively.

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template [template-name]
```

## Finding custom templates

We ship two templates by default:

- [`cra-template`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/cra-template)
- [`cra-template-typescript`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/cra-template-typescript)

However, you can find many great community templates by searching for ["cra-template-\*"](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=cra-template-*) on npm.

## Building a template

If you're interested in building a custom template, first take a look at how we've built [`cra-template`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/cra-template).

A template must have the following structure:

```
cra-template-[template-name]/
  README.md (for npm)
  template.json
  package.json
  template/
    README.md (for projects created from this template)
    gitignore
    public/
      index.html
    src/
      index.js (or index.tsx)
```

### Testing a template

To test a template locally, pass the file path to the directory of your template source using the `file:` prefix.

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template file:../path/to/your/template/cra-template-[template-name]
```

### The `template` folder

This folder is copied to the user's app directory as Create React App installs. During this process, the file `gitignore` is renamed to `.gitignore`.

You can add whatever files you want in here, but you must have at least the files specified above.

### The `template.json` file

This is the configuration file for your template. As this is a new feature, more options will be added over time. For now, only a `package` key is supported.

The `package` key lets you provide any keys/values that you want added to the new project's `package.json`, such as dependencies and any custom scripts that your template relies on.

Below is an example `template.json` file:

```json
{
  "package": {
    "dependencies": {
      "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y": "^6.2.3",
      "serve": "^11.2.0"
    },
    "scripts": {
      "serve": "serve -s build",
      "build-and-serve": "npm run build && npm run serve"
    },
    "eslintConfig": {
      "extends": ["react-app", "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended"],
      "plugins": ["jsx-a11y"]
    }
  }
}
```

Any values you add for `"dependencies"` and `"scripts"` will be merged with the Create React App defaults. Values for any other keys will be used as-is, replacing any matching Create React App defaults.

For convenience, we always replace `npm run` with `yarn` in your custom `"scripts"`, as well as in your `README` when projects are initialized with yarn.
```

There are various ways to setup a debugger for your Jest tests. We cover debugging in Chrome and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Debugging Tests in Chrome

Add the following to the `scripts` section in your project's `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
    "test:debug": "react-scripts --inspect-brk test --runInBand --no-cache"
  }
```

Place `debugger;` statements in any test and run:

```sh
$ npm run test:debug
```

This will start running your Jest tests, but pause before executing to allow a debugger to attach to the process.

Open the following in Chrome

```
about:inspect
```

After opening that link, the Chrome Developer Tools will be displayed. Select `inspect` on your process and a breakpoint will be set at the first line of the react script (this is done to give you time to open the developer tools and to prevent Jest from executing before you have time to do so). Click the button that looks like a "play" button in the upper right hand side of the screen to continue execution. When Jest executes the test that contains the debugger statement, execution will pause and you can examine the current scope and call stack.

> Note: the --runInBand cli option makes sure Jest runs test in the same process rather than spawning processes for individual tests. Normally Jest parallelizes test runs across processes but it is hard to debug many processes at the same time.

## Debugging Tests in Visual Studio Code

Debugging Jest tests is supported out of the box for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Use the following [`launch.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) configuration file:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug CRA Tests",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/react-scripts",
      "args": ["test", "--runInBand", "--no-cache", "--watchAll=false"],
      "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
      "protocol": "inspector",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen",
      "env": { "CI": "true" },
      "disableOptimisticBPs": true
    }
  ]
}
```
```
