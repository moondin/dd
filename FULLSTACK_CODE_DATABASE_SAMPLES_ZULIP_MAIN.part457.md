By default, everyone can change their name in Zulip. You can write your name
in any language you'd like.

Organization administrators can [change anyone's name](/help/change-a-users-name), and
[prevent users from changing their names](/help/restrict-name-and-email-changes). This
is useful when users' names are managed via LDAP or another data source.

### Change your name

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/profile" />

  1. Edit the **Name** field.

import {Steps, TabItem, Tabs} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

import FlattenedSteps from "../../components/FlattenedSteps.astro";
import NavigationSteps from "../../components/NavigationSteps.astro";

Zulip uses the time zone configured on your computer or mobile device for
displaying dates and times, such as when a message was sent.

You can [configure your **local time**](#configure-your-local-time) as it's
shown to other users in your [user card](/help/user-cards) and
[profile](/help/view-someones-profile). When your local time doesn't match your
computer's time zone, the Zulip web and desktop apps display a banner offering
to update it. If you don't want to see this banner, you can [hide
it](#hide-banner-when-time-zones-dont-match).

## Configure your local time

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <NavigationSteps target="settings/profile" />

      1. Under **Profile**, select a time zone.
    </FlattenedSteps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configure time zone used by Zulip to display dates and times

<Steps>
  1. Configure the time zone on your computer or mobile device.
  1. Reload Zulip.
</Steps>

## Hide banner when time zones don't match

If you local time in Zulip differs from your device's time zone (for example,
you changed your computer's time zone while traveling), you'll see a banner in
the web and desktop apps offering to update your local time to match your
computer's current time zone.

You can choose to permanently hide this banner.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <NavigationSteps target="settings/profile" />

<ChannelPrivacyTypes />

## Configure channel permissions

You can configure the following permissions for each channel,
regardless of its type.

Subscription permissions:

* [Who can administer the channel](/help/configure-who-can-administer-a-channel)
* [Who can subscribe themselves](/help/configure-who-can-subscribe)
* [Who can subscribe anyone](/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-channels#configure-who-can-subscribe-anyone-to-a-specific-channel)
* [Who can unsubscribe anyone](/help/configure-who-can-unsubscribe-others)

Messaging permissions:

* [Who can send messages](/help/channel-posting-policy)
* [Who can start new topics](/help/configure-who-can-start-new-topics)
* [Whether topics are required](/help/require-topics)

Moderation permissions:

* [Who can move messages](/help/restrict-moving-messages)
* [Who can resolve topics](/help/restrict-resolving-topics)
* [Who can delete messages](/help/restrict-message-editing-and-deletion)

For the organization as a whole, you can:

* [Restrict channel creation](/help/configure-who-can-create-channels)
* [Restrict who can subscribe others to channels](/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-channels#configure-who-can-subscribe-others-to-channels-in-general)

Any permission, including whether a channel is private, public, or web-public,
can be modified after the channel is created.

## Private channels

[Private channels](#private-channels) (indicated by <LockIcon />) are for conversations that should be visible to users who
are specifically granted access. There are two types of private channels in
Zulip:

* In private channels with **shared history**, new subscribers can access the
  channel's full message history. For example, a newly added team member can get
  ramped up on a secret project by seeing prior discussions.
* In private channels with **protected history**, new subscribers can only see
  messages sent after they join. For example, a new manager would not be able to
  see past discussions regarding their own hiring process or performance management.

<ChannelAdminPermissions />

Administrators can [export](/help/export-your-organization) messages in private
channels only if [granted permission to do
so](/help/export-your-organization#configure-whether-administrators-can-export-your-private-data)
by a subscriber.

Users who do not have special permissions (they are not organization
administrators, and have not been granted access to channel metadata) cannot
easily see which private channels exist. They can find out that a channel exists
only by attempting to create a channel with the same name, if they have
[permission to create channels](/help/configure-who-can-create-channels). They
can't get any other information about private channels they are not subscribed
to.

<ZulipNote>
  If you create a [bot](/help/bots-overview) that is allowed to read messages
  in a private channel (e.g., a **generic bot**, *not* an **incoming webhook bot**,
  which is more limited), an administrator can in theory gain access to messages
  in the channel by making themselves the bot's owner.
</ZulipNote>

## Public channels

Public channels (indicated by <HashtagIcon />) are open to all members of your organization other than
[guests](/help/guest-users). Anyone who is not a guest can:

* See information about the channel, including its name, description, permission
  settings, and subscribers.
* Subscribe or unsubscribe themselves to the channel.
* See all messages and topics, whether or not they are subscribed.

You can configure other permissions for public channels, such as [who is allowed
to post](/help/channel-posting-policy).

Guest users can't see public (or private) channels, unless they have been specifically
subscribed to the channel.

## Web-public channels

<WebPublicChannelsIntro />

Web-public channels are indicated with a **globe** (<GlobeIcon />) icon.

## Insert code formatting

Zulip's compose box has a smart **Code** (<CodeIcon />) button, which inserts contextually appropriate code
formatting:

* If no text is selected, the button inserts code block (` ``` `) formatting.
* If selected text is on one line, the button inserts code span (`` ` ``)
  formatting.
* If selected text is on multiple lines, the button inserts code block (` ``` `)
  formatting.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Via compose box button">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <StartComposing />

      1. *(optional)* Select the text you want to format.
      1. Click the **Code** (<CodeIcon />) icon at the
         bottom of the compose box to insert code formatting.
      1. *(optional)* To enable syntax highlighting in a code bock, start typing the
         name of the desired programming language directly after the initial ` ``` `.
         Select the language from the auto-complete suggestions.
    </FlattenedSteps>

    <ZulipTip>
      You can also use the **Code** (<CodeIcon />)
      icon to remove existing code formatting from the selected text.
    </ZulipTip>

    <KeyboardTip>
      You can also use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>
      to insert code formatting.
    </KeyboardTip>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Via Markdown">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <StartComposing />

      1. To create an inline code span, use single backticks around the text:
         `text`
         To create a code block, use triple backticks around the text:
         ```
         def f(x):
             return x+1
         ```
         To enable syntax highlighting, use triple backticks followed by one or more
         letters, and select the desired programming language from the auto-complete
         suggestions.
         ```python
         def fib(n):
             # TODO: base case
             return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
         ```
    </FlattenedSteps>

    <ZulipTip>
      You can also use `~~~` to start code blocks, or just indent the code 4 or more
      spaces.
    </ZulipTip>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Examples

<CodeBlocksExamples />

## Language tagging

Tagging a code block with a language enables syntax highlighting and
(if configured) [code playgrounds](#code-playgrounds). Zulip supports syntax
highlighting for hundreds of languages.

A code block can be tagged by typing the language name after the fence
(` ``` `) that begins a code block, as shown here.  Typeahead will
help you enter the name for the language.  The **Short names** values
from the [Pygments lexer documentation][pygments-lexers] are the
complete set of values that support syntax highlighting.

 ````
``` python
print("Hello world!")
```
 ````

### Default code block language

Organization administrators can also configure a default language for code
blocks, which will be used whenever the code block has no tag.

<AdminOnly />

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/organization-settings" />

  1. Under **Message feed settings**, edit **Default language for code blocks**.
</FlattenedSteps>

When a default language is configured, one can use ` ```text ` to display
code blocks without any syntax highlighting (e.g., to paste an error message).

## Code playgrounds

Code playgrounds are interactive in-browser development environments
that are designed to make it convenient to edit
and debug code. Code playgrounds can be configured for any programming language.
Zulip code blocks that are tagged with the language will have a button visible
on hover that allows you to open the code block in the code playground site.

### Add a custom code playground

<AdminOnly />

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/playground-settings" />

  1. Under **Add a new code playground**, enter a **Language**, **Name**, and
     **URL template**.
  1. Click **Add code playground**.
</FlattenedSteps>

For example, to configure code a playground for Rust, you could specify the
language and URL template as `Rust` and `https://play.rust-lang.org/?code={code}`.

When a code block is labeled as `rust` (either explicitly or by organization
default), users would get an on-hover option to open the code block in the
specified code playground.

<ZulipTip>
  Code playgrounds use [RFC 6570](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6570.html)
  compliant URL templates to describe how links should be generated. Zulip's
  rendering engine will pass the URL-encoded code from the code block as the
  `code` parameter, denoted as `{code}` in this URL template, in order to
  generate the URL. You can refer to parts of the documentation on URL
  templates from [adding a custom linkifier](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier).
</ZulipTip>

### Examples of playground URL templates

Here is a list of playground URL templates you can use for some popular
languages:

* For Java: `https://pythontutor.com/java.html#code={code}` or
  `https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/java_visualize/#code={code}`
* For JavaScript: `https://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#code={code}`
* For Python: `https://pythontutor.com/python-compiler.html#code={code}`
* For C: `https://pythontutor.com/c.html#code={code}`
* For C++: `https://pythontutor.com/cpp.html#code={code}`
* For Rust: `https://play.rust-lang.org/?code={code}`

### Technical details

* You can configure multiple playgrounds for a given language; if you do that,
  the user will get to choose which playground to open the code in.
* The **Language** field is the human-readable Pygments language name for that
  programming language. The language tag for a code block is internally mapped
  to these human-readable Pygments names; e.g., `py3` and `py` are mapped to
  `Python`. One can use the typeahead (which appears when you type something
  or just click on the language field) to look up the Pygments name.
* The links for opening code playgrounds are always constructed by substituting
  the URL-encoded contents of the code block into `code` variable in the URL template.
  The URL template is required to contain exactly one variable named `code`.
* Code playground sites do not always clearly document their URL format; often
  you can just get the prefix from your browser's URL bar.
* You can also use a custom language name to implement simple integrations.
  For example, a code block tagged with the "language" `send_tweet` could be
  used with a "playground" that sends the content of the code block as a Tweet.

If you have any trouble setting up a code playground, please [contact
us](/help/contact-support) with details on what you're trying to do, and we'll
be happy to help you out.

## Eligibility

In order to be eligible for listing in the communities directory, an
organization must be open to the public. Your organization is eligible
if users are allowed to [join without an invitation][join-without-invite]
and/or the [public access option](/help/public-access-option) is enabled.

The directory will be organized by [organization type](/help/organization-type),
so it is highly recommended that you make sure the appropriate category
is selected.

To prevent spam, Zulip reserves the right to use editorial discretion.
Giving Zulip permission to promote your organization in the communities
directory does not guarantee that it will be listed.

### Self-hosted Zulip communities

Zulip plans to develop support for self-hosted Zulip communities that
have registered their servers with the [Zulip mobile push
notification service][push-notifications] to sign-up for the Zulip
communities directory.

Until that feature is developed, if you administer a self-hosted Zulip
community and would like to be listed in the directory, please contact
[Zulip support](mailto:support@zulip.com). Changing the setting in your
Zulip organization will not send any information to the Zulip project
at this time, even if you use the Zulip mobile push notifications
service.

[join-without-invite]: /help/restrict-account-creation#set-whether-invitations-are-required-to-join

[communities-directory-permission]: /help/communities-directory#give-permission-to-be-in-the-zulip-communities-directory

[push-notifications]: https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/mobile-push-notifications.html

## Change whether your organization may be listed in the Zulip communities directory

<AdminOnly />

<CommunitiesDirectoryInstructions />

<ZulipTip>
  Organizations that are not open to the public will not be listed at this time.
  If you administer a non-public organization, please check the box to request
  to be listed in the future.
